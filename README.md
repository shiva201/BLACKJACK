Card Values: In Blackjack, each card has a specific value. Number cards (2 to 10) are worth their face value, face cards (Jack, Queen, and King) are worth 10, and the Ace can be worth either 1 or 11, depending on the player's choice and what is more beneficial for the hand.

Starting the Game: The game begins with each player and the dealer receiving two cards. Both player cards are usually dealt face up, while the dealer has one card face up (the "upcard") and one card face down (the "hole card").

Player's Turn: Each player takes turns to decide whether to "hit" (request another card) to improve their hand's total value or "stand" (decline additional cards) if they believe their hand is strong enough. Players can continue to hit until they choose to stand or their hand exceeds 21, resulting in a "bust," which means they lose the round.

Dealer's Turn: After all players have completed their turns, the dealer reveals their hole card. The dealer must follow a specific set of rules, usually hitting until their hand value is 17 or higher. If the dealer busts, all remaining players win. If the dealer doesn't bust, their hand is compared to each player's hand to determine the winners.

Winning Conditions: The player wins if their hand's value is closer to 21 than the dealer's hand or if the dealer busts. If the player's hand value equals the dealer's, it results in a "push," and the player neither wins nor loses.

Blackjack: A "Blackjack" occurs when a player's initial two cards are an Ace and a 10-point card (10, Jack, Queen, or King). A Blackjack is the strongest hand in the game and typically pays out at a higher rate than a regular win.

Betting and Payouts:

Blackjack is often played with betting involved. Players place bets before the cards are dealt, and the payout for winning hands is usually 1:1 (even money). However, a Blackjack win typically pays 3:2, meaning the player receives 1.5 times their original bet.
